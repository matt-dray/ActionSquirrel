# ActionSquirrel

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Project Status: Concept â€“ Minimal or no implementation has been done yet, or the repository is only intended to be a limited example, demo, or proof-of-concept.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/concept.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#concept)
<!-- badges: end -->

{ActionSquirrel} is an R package containing a (very work-in-progress) interactive visual experience ('game') in the R console, powered by [{R6}](https://r6.r-lib.org/). You play as the titular Action Squirrel. Move around and collect nuts for winter, while avoiding the predatory owl.

## How to play

### Install 

The package is available from GitHub.

```{r eval= FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")  # if not installed already
remotes::install_github("matt-dray/ActionSquirrel")
```

Attach the package for instructions.

```{r}
library(ActionSquirrel)
```

### Start

Initiate by assigning `ActionSquirrel$new()` to a name. This clears the console and generates a forest that contains Action Squirrel. And a delicious nut. And a scary owl!

```{r}
x <- ActionSquirrel$new()
```

Note: Action Squirrel nor the nut nor the owl are as big as a tree. It's just perspective.

### Move

You control Action Squirrel. Use the `move()` method to move through the forest and grab the nuts. Make sure not to be eaten by the owl.

```{r}
x$move("up")
```

Congratulations, your move tally has increased by one.

Did I mention there's sound effects? You'll have to play to find out.

To the nut!

```{r}
x$move("left")
```

Congratulations, your nut tally has increased by one. And there's a new nut!

Advanced tech: you only need the first letter of the direction, like `x$move("r")` for right, and you can chain moves together like `x$move("r")$move("d")` to go right then down.

Keep collecting nuts until winter arrives (30 moves). Collect as many nuts as possible without being eaten.

```{r}
x$move("left")
```

Oops.
