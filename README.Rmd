# ActionSquirrel

<!-- badges: start -->
[![Project Status: Concept â€“ Minimal or no implementation has been done yet, or the repository is only intended to be a limited example, demo, or proof-of-concept.](https://www.repostatus.org/badges/latest/concept.svg)](https://www.repostatus.org/#concept)

_Action Squirrel_ is a (very work-in-progress) interactive R-console experience ('game') made with [the {R6} package](https://r6.r-lib.org/).

## Install

Available from GitHub only.

```{r eval= FALSE}
install.packages("remotes")  # if not installed already
remotes::install_github("matt-dray/ActionSquirrel")
```

## How to play

Start with `ActionSquirrel$new()`. This will first clear the console.

```{r}
library(ActionSquirrel)
x <- ActionSquirrel$new()
```

Use the `move()` method to move Action Squirrel. Again, the console will first be cleared.

Go up!

```{r}
x$move("up")
```

Right!

```{r}
x$move("right")
```

Down!

```{r}
x$move("down")
```

Other right!

```{r}
x$move("left")
```

Note that Action Squirrel is not as big as a tree. It's just perspective.

## TODO

* Handle hard boundary
* Add random nut
* Tally nut points
* Add enemy
* Add timer/step count
* Play through seasons?
* Gamify properly
